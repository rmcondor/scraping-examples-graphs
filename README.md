## Project List

The repository contains the following web scraping projects:

### UNMSM's Admission Exams
The objective of these codes is to scrape the results of the 2023-II and 2024-I UNMSM's exams, then clean it and finally get a simple dataset (in Stata format).

The exams comprises 100 multiple-choice questions —ranging from mathematics to social sciences, humanities, physics, chemistry, and biology— and spans a duration of 3 hours. Each correct answer carries 20 points, while an incorrect response deducts 1.125 points, and blank answers hold no point value. The maximum (and nearly impossible) score is 2,000 points.

### UNMSM's electoral register
The objetive of this code is to read almost 30 PDF files and consolidate all information in one simple dataset.

From time to time, UNMSM students are called to vote for the election of their student and administrative representatives. There is an Electoral Committee, which is in charge of publishing the electoral roll on the Internet, so that students know where they have to go to cast their vote. In addition, this list publishes relevant student information, such as their academic standing, aggregate grade and accumulated credits.
